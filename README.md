# dotfiles
All of my linux configuration files.



The /etc/hosts file is the hosts file for blocking unwanted sites, and routing them to 0.0.0.0. Some sites are routed to 127.0.0.1, which will have the same effect, but slower.

Some configuration files are downloaded, but all are somewhat modified. Here are the people that hold the original. nitsuga5124: https://gitlab.com/nitsuga5124 (neovim config) elenapan: https://github.com/elenapan (awesome window manager config) Sloopy3333: https://github.com/Sloopy3333 (qtile config) Axarva: https://github.com/Axarva (xmonad config) adi1090x: https://github.com/adi1090x (polybar config)

NOTE: I don't use that polybar config anymore but too lazy to push :P
